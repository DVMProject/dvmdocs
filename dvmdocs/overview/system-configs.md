# Example System Configurations

This page will explain the basic types of digital radio systems that can be created using DVMProject, and
provide links to guides and more information on installing and configuring each component within the system.

The configurations on this page begin with the simplest setup (single-channel conventional systems), and it's
good pratice to read through each section to familiarize yourself with the building blocks that will be used
in later, more complex multi-channel and multi-site systems.

## Conventional Mixed-Mode Single-Channel System

### Requirements

- [Hotspot](/dvmdocs/overview/supported-hardware.md#hotspots) or [Modem](/dvmdocs/overview/supported-hardware.md#modems)
- Computer running linux and the [dvmhost](/dvmdocs/software/dvmhost/dvmhost.md) application 
- P25-, DMR-, or NXDN-capable radio

### Setup

### Configuration

## Conventional P25 Single-Channel System with Control Messaging

## Voice-On-Control P25 Single-Channel System

**NOTE: This system type is no longer recommended as most radios do not support voice-on-control operation properly**

## Basic P25 Trunking Site (Dedicated Control & Voice Channels)
